This repo may git very hairy in a fat hurry...

(yes, the git pun was intended)

Because I'm a noob at making RPM's the binaries and a LOT of cruft may end up in the git repo.  
Good news / bad news.  

Good news is that I will git a lot of experience maintaining and cleaning out crap from a repository. 

Bad news is that the repo is going to be absolute sheeeit - frequently

You have been warned...
